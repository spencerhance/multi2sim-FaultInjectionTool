Introduction:
**************
This fault injection tool is meant to be used as a tool to launch
massive Multi2Sim fault injection simulations on a cluster.  Multi2Sim 
is a heterogenous system simulator available at 
https://www.multi2sim.org. The tool is currently working with 
multi2sim-4.2 Evergreen architecture and SLURM as the cluster 
management tool.

Modules:
**************
The fault_injection_tool folder includes 3 files, fault_tool.sh, 
process_results.py, and fault_gen.py.  The fault_tool bash script is
the central script where everything is launched. fault_gen.py is an
internal module which will generate the m2s fault files needed for m2s
fault_injection.  process_results.py is an internal module which 
processes the results and creates a sqlite3 database with important 
information from the simulations.

Usage:
**************
To run the tool, the fault_tool.sh bash script must be run from the 
command line
The syntax is as follows:

--sim <ssh_server> <benchmark_name> <fault_type> <num_faults> <ssh_port>
	runs simulation of benchmark_name with num_faults injected 
	into memory region fault_type
		ssh_server: user@ip_of_cluster
		benchmark_name: name of benchmark to run
		fault_type: region to inject faults in (mem, reg, or ams)
		num_faults: number of faults to inject
		ssh_port: default is 22
	
--status <ssh_server>
	returns status of running simulations
        	ssh_server: user@ip_of_cluster
--get-results
	pulls results from server to client

In order to launch the simulations, the --sim command must be used
with its requisite input.  If no port number is specified it will 
default to 22.  While the program is running you will be prompted 
for the m2s and benchmark directories on the cluster as well as any
benchmark arguments.  Additionally, you have the ability to specify 
the number of compute units.  The fault generation will choose a 
random number between 0 and the number you specify for each fault
file.  Alternatively, the default number is 19, which includes 
all of the possible compute units.

Once the simulations have completed, there will a directory on the 
head node ending in "results."  This folder contains a sub-directory
for every fault that was created.  In each of those sub-directories
will be a fault file, debug file, benchmark output file, and a 
m2s output file from that simulation run.  These results are also 
parsed and located in a ".db" file in the node with a prefix 
of the slurm-ID.  When --get-results is run, the results folder 
will be copied back to the fault_injection_tool folder as a tarball, 
as well as the database.

Results:
**************
To view your results on your machine, navigate to the 
fault_injection_tool folder in terminal and run this command:

$ sqlite3 <path_to_database> -column

This will open up a sqlite3 terminal.  Then type:

sqlite> .headers on

This will turn on headers to make viewing the data easier.  
The next step is to open the table.  This is done with the 
following command:

sqlite> SELECT * FROM <table_name>;

The table_name will be either "MemFaults,"RegFaults," or "AmsFaults," 
depending on the simulation you suggested.  This will display all 
of the fault injection data in your terminal window
